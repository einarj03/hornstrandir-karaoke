      Friday night and the lights are low
      Looking out for a place to go
      Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
      You come to look for a king
      Anybody could be that guy
      Night is young and the music's high
      With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
      You're in the mood for a dance

      Having the time of your life
      Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
      Digging the dancing queen",

      You're a teaser, you turn 'em on

      I think you know that you won't be away too long
      You know that I'm not that strong",

      Bye bye, leave me now or never
      Mamma mia, it's a game we play
      Bye bye doesn't mean forever",

      I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
      I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
